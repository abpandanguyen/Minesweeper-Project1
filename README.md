<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game where the objective is to clear a rectangular board that is laid with hidden 'mines' without detonating any of them. Clicking on a tile will either reveal a mine and result in a loss or reveal an empty tile that can be adjacent to zero or even eight mines. Victory is achieved by clicking all unmined tiles.</p>
